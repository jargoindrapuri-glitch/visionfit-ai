## 📍 Phase 1: High-Fidelity Foundation (Current)
*Focus: Achieving the most realistic visual output possible.*

- [x] **Identity-Preserving Generative AI**: Integration with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image for realistic garment draping.
- [x] **Universal Garment Support**: Support for tops, bottoms, dresses, and outerwear.
- [x] **User-Centric Inputs**: Manual height/weight inputs for basic scaling.
- [x] **Integrated Cropping Tool**: Ensure optimal aspect ratios (3:4) for AI processing.
- [x] **Responsive Discovery Grid**: Pinterest-style UI for seamless product browsing.

## 📍 Phase 2: Precision & Personalization (Q3 2024)
*Focus: Transitioning from "visual representation" to "digital tailoring".*

- [ ] **AI Body Measurement Extraction**: 
  - Use Gemini 3 Flash to estimate precise measurements (chest, waist, hips, inseam) from the uploaded photo.
- [ ] **Dynamic Fit Feedback**: 
  - Visual heatmaps showing where a garment might be "too tight" or "loose" based on user dimensions.
- [ ] **Personalized Style Profile**: 
  - AI-driven "Style Concierge" that recommends items based on user body type and previous try-ons.
- [ ] **Multiple Pose Support**: 
  - Allow users to upload 3-5 photos to generate a 360-degree try-on view.

## 📍 Phase 3: The "Smart Suit" Interactive Experience (Q4 2024)
*Focus: Real-time interactivity and advanced fabric physics.*

- [ ] **Fabric Physics Engine**: 
  - Integration of real-world fabric data (stretch, weight, transparency) to simulate movement.
- [ ] **Live AR Mirror**: 
  - Real-time video try-on using the Live API and native audio conversation for instant style advice.
- [ ] **Smart Lighting Sync**: 
  - Use environment data from the user's camera to match the lighting of the AI-generated garment to the user's room.
- [ ] **Multi-Garment Layering**: 
  - Ability to try on a full outfit (e.g., shirt, jacket, and trousers) simultaneously.

## 📍 Phase 4: Social & Global Integration (Q1 2025)
*Focus: Community, commerce, and platform expansion.*

- [ ] **"Style with Friends" (Live API)**: 
  - Shared virtual fitting rooms where friends can join via voice/video to give feedback.
- [ ] **Shopify App Store Launch**: 
  - One-click integration for 1M+ merchants with automated catalog scanning.
- [ ] **Digital Twin Vault**: 
  - Secure storage for user body data, enabling one-tap try-ons across any partner retailer.
- [ ] **Eco-Impact Dashboard**: 
  - Track how much carbon is saved by reducing shipping returns through accurate sizing.
